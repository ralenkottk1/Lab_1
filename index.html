        <h3>Things about me</h3>
        <p> Favorite book? I have many favorite authors, Dean Koontz writes very exciting books. I really enjoy the Harry Potter books. </p>
        <p> Favorite TV show? I don't watch TV very often. I mainly do if I want background noise while doing something else. But, my favorite show would be The Office. </p>
        <p>Favorite food? I love fruits, strawberries are my favorite. I also really love vegtable pizza. Favorite music? </p>
        <p> I truly love all types of music. Oldies, alternative, rap, classic, and many more! The only style I do not like is country.</p>
        <p> Favorite color? I love any blues and greens! </p>
        <p>What makes me feel better when I am down? I love to play with my puppy and take him to the dog park. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and family as well as alone time. </p>
